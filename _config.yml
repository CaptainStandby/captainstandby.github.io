        description: >
          For my home automation project I wanted to monitor the flow and return flow
          temperature of the heating system in my home.
          The boiler has analog gauges only. I connected an IP Camera to a RaspberryPi
          to capture pictures of the gauges. Using image processing with OpenCV I
          implemented a service in Python to measure the displayed temperature. The
          measurements were then exposed via a Prometheus interface.
